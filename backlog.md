[OpenWeatherMapWidget](https://github.com/desyat/OpenWeatherMapWidget) App store: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/1f3f2d10-ac05-4a9b-a8fa-bdeac8775793 ; 
This is a good example of how background processes work. Feel free to give me suggestions on improving the code.
There is also an example of Glance View for widgets.


[Tkadla-GSG/garmin](https://github.com/Tkadla-GSG/garmin)
I am not sure if this was shared before, but here it goes: 
3 simple games, including Flappy Bird (It's the only one I've tested on the simulator, it works).
The source code is clean and easy to read (and learn). This guy has even some unit tests!

[IQ Meteo for vivoactive HR](https://github.com/antirez/iqmeteo)
Main features of this widget:
Uses the GPS to get the user position, in order to fetch Yahoo weather information for the exact location.
Caching of the GPS position. It is only re-fetched if the user long presses the vivoactive HR right button.
Programmatically generated icons: fast and small.
Auto switch of temperature unit based on device configuration.
Single view current condition and forecasts.
Easy with CPU and battery. It caches the latest condition in order to just render it immediately, while performign the new query. Does not query again if less than 30 seconds elapsed since the latest query.


[Garmin Battery Guesstimate](https://github.com/individual-it/BatteryGuesstimate/)
Shows the battery consumption over time and estimates how long the battery would last (better than the build-in estimation).
Not sure if there is yet anything to learn from (as I'm still very confused myself), but I published my first app also on GitHub https://github.com/individual-it/BatteryGuesstimate/
It's a small app that remembers the status of the battery, shows a graph and estimates how long it might last if the discharge is similar like in the past x minutes/hours

[OPN-MonkeyC](https://gitlab.com/waterkip/opn-monkeyc) - was mantioned in develepers forum, but it is not clear what it is

[Atom Fast Dosimeter Application](https://github.com/newenclave/AtomAppGN)
The application doesn't turn your watch into a dosimeter. It uses an Atom Fast device to read and show the data.

[barrels from garmin](https://github.com/garmin/connectiq-apps/tree/master/barrels)
Monkey Barrels are a way for developers to create custom Monkey C libraries containing source code and resource information that can be easily shared across Connect IQ Projects. To find out more about Monkey Barrels, please see the Shareable Libraries chapter in the Programmer's Guide.

[Horizontal-speedo-rep](https://github.com/dazey77/Horizontal-speedo-rep)
Its a horizontal speedo app for the GPSMAP 66 series (specifically 66SR).  Designed to allow huge display and to override the 1 frame per second refresh limit of the Garmin GPS.  Button pushes allow control of day/night, backlight on/off, selection of 3 speed ranges, trip 1 & 2 reset and FPS adjust between 2&10 FPS.

[Badminton Score Tracker](https://apps.garmin.com/pl-PL/apps/51606451-57e2-4f99-9420-2ba5a80b5df6) [GitHub - matco/badminton at dev](https://github.com/matco/badminton/tree/dev.) May be good. Quite fresh. "- "Save matches as Garmin Connect activities" - could be good example for saving custom activities.

[GitHub - rgibert/garmin-podcasts: Garmin Podcasts is a Garmin Connect IQ podcast app powered by Podcast Index. No external service or subscription required: all you need is you watch!](https://github.com/rgibert/garmin-podcasts) 
An example of audio content provider app. Look very solid. Good user's docs.

[GitHub - xehpuk/parkrun-barcode-garmin-connect-iq: Never forget your barcode again!](https://github.com/xehpuk/parkrun-barcode-garmin-connect-iq) 
Doesn't do much, but it looks nice. Contains a glance view.

[GitHub - danielsiwiec/timebomb: Timebomb game for garmin](https://github.com/danielsiwiec/timebomb). Looks like a game. Had not run it yet. The code seems clean. There is even a model passd to the delegate. Don't expect sofisticated mechanics/techniques, though.

[andryuha49/GarminTrexGame](https://github.com/andryuha49/GarminTrexGame) Quite fresh (2020), good readme. Game from google chrome. (A bit slow, judging from the demo video. Not sure if coding/techniques are good.)

[https://github.com/hansiglaser/ConnectIQ](https://github.com/hansiglaser/ConnectIQ) Collection of Garmin Connect IQ apps. SimpleWaF (watch face) is a very simple watch face, just a finger exercise. ShowAllInfos (widget) retrieves all available information (e.g., screen size, heart rate, ...) and displays it. SensorViz (app) interactively visualizes the readings of the accelerometer and the magnetometer in 3D.

[Contrast Shower](https://github.com/aiMonster/Garmin-Contrast-Shower)
https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/9499ec2c-d424-4135-a62d-130956bc1a6f
A watch application that helps you to take a contrast shower every day and keep your health in great shape. It will notify you with vibration on every cycle end, so you don't miss to switch the water. The application allows you to configure the number of cycles and their duration. Also, it allows you to record activity, so you could track your progress.

[Garmin 3D Benchmark](https://github.com/tomasslavicek/garmin3D) App Store: https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/c39b8b25-7ac8-4481-b8be-8899ef12facc
 This is a 3D game engine benchmark to test how fast is your device.
All positions of objects are calculated in 3D coordinates, multiplied by View and Projective matrices. You can press Up and Down buttons to rotate with the scene. Whole screen is redrawn every frame, you can see the number of frames per second on the top
